For assignment-2 we decided to switch from Oxford English Dictionary API to wordAPI. Both API is very similar in functionality and features so our project proposal from assignment-1 will be unchanged. The reason for our change is that we later realized that due to security issues, Oxford English Dictionary API will deny any client-side application requests.

This is a forum post on the official Oxford English Dictionary API forum posted by an Administrator that details the issues that we faced:
